!!Results of those two models are not directly comparable as stated in the thesis
manuscript, since they are trained with different datasets, and also their number. 
However, observations can still be viewed about how COCO trained models with
different augmentations perform under low and normal illumination, and also how
ExDark trained models with different augmentations perform under the same.!!
